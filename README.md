> A Python data processing pipeline for automated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) expansion and differentiation.
> 
This repository holds the python modules of the data processing pipeline for the automated cell culture platform. The hiPSCs are cultivated for expansion and differentiation into brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) for an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) as described in [Efficiency unleashed: Streamlined and automated data processing in high-throughput monoclonal antibody production](link_to_preprint) and [Human iPSC-derived brain endothelial microvessels in a multi-well format enable permeability screens of anti-inflammatory drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014296122200165X?via%3Dihub)
